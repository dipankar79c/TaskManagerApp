# TaskManagerApp

In today’s world, individuals often need to keep track of various tasks in a structured way. This Task Manager app allows users to manage their tasks. The system includes user authentication, meaning each user has to log in with a username and password. Once logged in, users can create, view, update, and delete their tasks. Each user’s tasks are stored separately in a txt file and only the authenticated user can access their tasks.
